            Low budget airlines make it easy to get to Varanasi both from abroad and from many major local cities. 
            Spicejet and Kingfisher are two Indian airlines offering quick and inexpensive flights from the city 
            to dozens of other Indian cities. This can save days off your traveling time. Keep in mind that airport 
            here is not always organized so make all ticketing arrangements before you leave. The Babatpur airport 
            is about 22 km from the center of town. You will need to hire a taxi or get a bus from the airport.

      <h3>By Train</h3>

            One of the easiest ways to get to Varanasi is by train. Cities as such Delhi and Mumbai have several 
            trains to get you directly here fast and cheaply. Overnight cars are available with private compartments. 
            Trains are divided into first, second and third classes. Consider splurging on first class as it is safer. 
            This is a major railway connection for the rest of the country so connections are plentiful and constant. 
            Book in advance if you want access to air-conditioned cars.

      <h3>By Bus</h3>

            Buses are another option. However, bear in mind that buses run on roads that are not always well kept. 
            A bus journey can take long as the driver needs to stop frequently. They are the cheapest mode of 
            transportation both to the city and when getting around.
